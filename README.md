# GDStatistics

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DoubleCookies/GDStatistics.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DoubleCookies/GDStatistics)

Tool for collecting statistics about Geometry Dash featured levels. Created with [jdash](https://github.com/Alex1304/jdash).

## Features
- Collect information about featured and epic levels.
- Split statistics by level difficulties.
- Additional lists with info about level descriptions, soundtracks, level creators.
- Little bonus: top-50 most popular demons.

## Structure
- **Statistics** folder contains a lot of markdown lists with different statistics information. All lists generated in Markdown (that's why you can see information directly on GitHub).
   - Root folder contain lists for all levels and additional lists (for soundtracks, builders, etc.)
   - Subfolders contain lists for difficulties (featured and epic levels stats only).
- **src** folder contains sources for this project.

## Plans
- Describe how project works (maybe with illustrations)
